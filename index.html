    <p>
      He bravely crossed the cold, flooded trenches filled with soldiers enduring hunger and exhaustion.
      Finally, he has reached a small earth-and-wooden shelter where his officer, along with other officials,
      is examining topographic maps of the Verdun region south of the Meuse River, identifying the positions
      of the Germans in the trenches around Metz. Jacques now awaits further orders and the encrypted document

    <h2>Challenge 2: A World Divided</h2>
    <p>
      Jacques takes a moment to recall how alliances shifted from before the war to the current year, 1916.
      He reflects on the alliances that once sought to maintain a balance of power, but now have expanded the
      space of conflict. The Triple Entente has grown stronger, and new powers have joined the war effort on
      both sides, turning Europe into a vast battleground. As he studies the map of the current fronts, he
      laments how the war has dragged more nations into its deadly grasp.

    <p>
      "How could it have come to this?" Jacques wonders. "What once were treaties of defense now fuel the
      relentless expansion of war."

    <h2>1914: The movements war</h2>
    <p>
      Jacques recalls the events from July to December 1914. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo set off a chain of events, leading to Austria-Hungary's ultimatum to Serbia and eventually the declaration of war. Germany supported Austria-Hungary while France, Russia, and Britain stood together. The war escalated quickly with Germany invading Belgium and advancing into France, but the French stopped them at the Battle of the Marne. By December, the war had settled into a deadly stalemate of trench warfare.

  <p>
    Summary: 1914 - The Beginning of the Great War
    On June 28, 1914, the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, and his wife in Sarajevo triggered a series of events that led to the outbreak of World War I. Initially, the event went almost unnoticed, but it soon became the spark for a global conflict. Long-standing tensions among Europe’s great powers, fueled by colonial, economic, and military rivalries, found an outlet in this incident.

    Europe was divided into two main blocs: the Triple Alliance (Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy) and the Triple Entente (France, Russia, and Britain). For years, diplomatic efforts had managed to defuse tensions, but the Sarajevo assassination disrupted the fragile balance. Austria-Hungary blamed Serbia for the attack and issued a harsh ultimatum, which Serbia partially rejected. On July 28, 1914, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia.

    Russia, allied with Serbia and a defender of Slavic nations in the Balkans, mobilized its troops against Austria-Hungary. Germany, allied with Austria-Hungary, perceived Russian mobilization as a direct threat and declared war on Russia on August 1, 1914, and on France, Russia’s ally, on August 3. Germany’s military strategy, known as the Schlieffen Plan, aimed to quickly defeat France by invading through neutral Belgium. This violation of Belgian neutrality prompted Britain, Belgium’s guarantor, to declare war on Germany on August 4.

    The Outbreak of War
    Within weeks, Europe’s major powers were at war. The scale of mobilization was massive: over 10 million men were called to arms in the early months. Any hope of a quick war was soon dashed. Initial battles, such as the Battle of the Frontiers, resulted in enormous casualties and revealed the grim reality of a prolonged and costly conflict.

    Germany’s invasion of Belgium encountered unexpected resistance, delaying its advance towards France. Despite this, German forces reached the outskirts of Paris in early September. However, in the Battle of the Marne (September 6–13), Franco-British forces halted the German advance, marking the beginning of trench warfare. Both sides dug defensive lines stretching from the North Sea to Switzerland, creating a static and deadly Western Front.

    The Eastern Front and the Balkans
    While trench warfare dominated the Western Front, battles on the Eastern Front were more mobile. Germany achieved major victories over Russia at Tannenberg and the Masurian Lakes, inflicting heavy casualties. In contrast, Austria-Hungary faced humiliating defeats against Russia and Serbia, highlighting its military weaknesses and dependence on Germany.

    The Global Impact and New Players
    In November 1914, the Ottoman Empire joined the Central Powers, opening new fronts in the Caucasus against Russia and in the Middle East against Britain. European colonial possessions also became battlegrounds. Japan, allied with Britain, declared war on Germany and seized German colonies in the Pacific. In Africa, both the Allies and Central Powers fought over colonial territories.

    Life at the Front and at Home
    The war brought suffering not only to the battlefield but also to civilian populations. Economies were transformed to support the war effort. In Germany, Britain’s naval blockade caused severe shortages of food and essential goods, affecting civilians deeply.

    Conditions at the front were harrowing. Soldiers lived in trenches plagued by rats, mud, and constant artillery bombardment. Casualties were staggering; by the end of 1914, 350,000 French, 250,000 Germans, and hundreds of thousands from other nations had died.

    The Legacy of 1914
    By December 1914, it was evident that the war would be long and devastating. The initial offensive strategies of both sides had failed, and the conflict turned into a war of attrition, where victory would depend on endurance and resource mobilization.
